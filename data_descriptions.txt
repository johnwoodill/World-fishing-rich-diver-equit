Data Description:
 	- GFW AIS: 10d resolution from 2012 - 2016
 		- flag
 		- mmsi
 		- fishing hours
 		- gear type

 	- Measure of Diversity (dependent variable binned into none, low, medium, high)
 		- Richness - # of unique flags in a grid cell
 		- Shannon Diversity - calculated from # obs in grid and shannon div function

	- CMIP6: 1d resolution at 15-year averages (historical: 2000-2014, ssp126 projections: 2014 - 2090)
	    - ARAGOS: Aragonite concentration
        - CHLOS: Mass Concentration of Total Phytoplankton expressed as Chlorophyll
        - O2SATOS: Surface Dissolved Oxygen Concentration at Saturation
        - PHOS: ph
        - SOS: Sea Surface Salinity
        - SIOS: Surface Total Dissolved Inorganic Silicon Concentration
        - TOS: Sea Surface Temperature
        - ZOOCOS: Surface Zooplankton Carbon Concentration

 	- Features (at each grid)
 		- CMIP6 data (mean, min, max, variance, skewness, kurtosis)
 		- lat/lon
 		- distance to coast
 		- distance to major port
 		- located inside EEZ
 		- located inside MPA
 		- located in major RFMO
 		- flag has been present before
 		- gear type has been present before

Data Step:
	1. Regrid GFW data to 1d to match CMIP6 (sum at each grid and year)
	2. Calculate measure of diversity using GFW and average across time series
	3. Bind CMIP6 variables across grids and average every 15-year interval
	4. Calculate features of CMIP6 grids (distance to coast, etc)
	5. Bind GFW and CMIP6 data together by grids (1d lat/lon)

Model Step:
	1. Estimate Random Forest Classification for each measure of diversity
	2. Cross-validation Hyper-parameter tuning to increase accuracy (5-10% increase)
	3. 10-fold cross validation to measure train/test accuracy
	4. Train model on full data set
	5. Predict using CMIP6 projection every 15 years

	- 46,129 # obs (unique grids)
	- 188 # features
	- 122 # flags
	- Classification Accuracy
		- Richness - 84.31%
		- Shannon Div - 76.45%
